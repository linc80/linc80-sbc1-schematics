# Schematics for LiNC80 SBC 1

For now, this repository contains PDF versions of the 
schematic and board layout. Later, the actual KiCAD
source files will be published here.

The reason for this two-step publication, is to allow
us the advantage of being first to provide the hardware
implementation of this design.
